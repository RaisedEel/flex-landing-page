In this proyect I managed to copy the whole design of the odin landing page given.
The design was copied using only the flex layout and a lot of divs.
If you resize the page, all the elements acomodate and nothings gets pushed out of
the viewpoint.


Things to do in the future:

* Add a theme.
* Add correspending images to the theme.
